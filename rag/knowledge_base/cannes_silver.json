    "category": "Data-Driven, Social & Influencer",
    "insight": "People's music tastes are deeply personal, sometimes embarrassing, and always shareable. Listening data tells stories about who we really are.",
    "single_minded_proposition": "Your year, told through the music you actually listened to.",
    "strategy": "Transform private listening data into personalised, shareable year-end stories. Give every user their own micro-campaign to post on social media, turning 400M users into brand ambassadors.",
    "creative_idea": "Personalised data visualisations showing each user's listening habits - top artists, minutes listened, genres, guilty pleasures - in a bold, shareworthy design format.",
    "why_it_won": "Turned first-party data into the world's most effective user-generated content engine. Every user becomes a Spotify ad. Single insight, infinite personalised executions. Annual cultural moment created from scratch.",
    "effectiveness_notes": "60M shares annually. App downloads spike 21% every December. Proof that a single, repeatable idea built on genuine insight becomes an owned cultural moment."

    "year": 2020,
    "award": "Silver",
    "category": "Print & Publishing, Outdoor",
    "insight": "Fast food that never rots (like competitors' products) is deeply unnatural. Consumers claim to want 'real food' but have never seen what preservative-free fast food actually looks like.",
    "single_minded_proposition": "Real food rots. And that's a beautiful thing.",
    "strategy": "Show a Whopper decomposing over 34 days in time-lapse photography to prove BK has removed artificial preservatives. Turn the category convention of perfect-looking food on its head.",
    "creative_idea": "Time-lapse photography of a Whopper growing mold over 34 days, presented as beauty shots. Tagline: 'The beauty of no artificial preservatives.'",
    "why_it_won": "Category-defying bravery. The opposite of every food ad ever made. Single-minded proposition supported by irrefutable visual proof. Demonstrates the IPA principle that distinctive, emotion-provoking creative earns fame and business results.",
    "effectiveness_notes": "8.4 billion impressions. $40M earned media. Shows that truly distinctive creative that breaks category conventions generates disproportionate returns."

    "year": 2019,
    "award": "Silver",
    "category": "Creative Strategy, PR",
    "insight": "Crash test dummies are modelled on average male bodies. Women are 47% more likely to be seriously injured in a car crash because cars aren't designed for female bodies.",
    "single_minded_proposition": "Cars have been designed to protect men. We're sharing 40 years of safety data to protect everyone.",
    "strategy": "Open-source 40 years of Volvo's crash data that accounts for all body types - not just male - and challenge the entire industry to design safer cars for women. Position Volvo as the only brand that has always tested for all bodies.",
    "creative_idea": "Published the E.V.A. (Equal Vehicles for All) research library, visualised the data gap in car safety, and called on competitors to use the data.",
    "why_it_won": "Turned Volvo's longstanding safety credentials into a gender equality story. One insight, one action (open-sourcing data), one clear desired response (adopt our data). Purpose-driven but firmly tied to the product truth.",
    "effectiveness_notes": "2.7B reach. Drove purchase consideration up 139%. Demonstrates that the best purpose-driven work is anchored in product truth, not borrowed social causes."

    "year": 2019,
    "award": "Silver",
    "category": "Print & Publishing, PR",
    "insight": "Lebanon had gone without a government for 6 months. The news was the same every day - political deadlock, no progress, nothing happening. Citizens felt powerless and numb.",
    "single_minded_proposition": "When politicians do nothing, the news is nothing.",
    "strategy": "Publish an entirely blank newspaper to dramatise the government vacuum. The absence of content becomes the story. Force the issue into global conversation.",
    "creative_idea": "An entire edition of Annahar - Lebanon's leading newspaper - published with completely blank pages. No articles, no photos, no ads. Just empty white space with the masthead.",
    "why_it_won": "The most single-minded brief possible: say nothing to say everything. Bold, provocative, and impossible to ignore. The blank format forced people to confront what was missing. Clear desired response: outrage, action.",
    "effectiveness_notes": "400M impressions. International media coverage. Government formed weeks later. Shows that the most powerful creative ideas reduce to their absolute essence."

    "single_minded_proposition": "Reclaim a racist phrase and turn it into the most positive travel invitation.",
    "strategy": "Use AI to find every instance of 'Go back to Africa' on social media, then automatically respond with stunning images and travel deals to African destinations. Reclaim the hate speech as an actual travel recommendation.",
    "creative_idea": "An AI-powered system that monitored social media for racist 'Go back to Africa' posts and responded with beautiful African travel imagery and bookable trips.",
    "why_it_won": "Brilliant reframe. Took something negative and flipped it into something aspirational. Single-minded proposition executed through data and technology. The insight, strategy, and creative were perfectly aligned.",
    "effectiveness_notes": "Travel bookings up 200%. 1B impressions. Demonstrates that reframing a cultural tension through a single-minded lens creates both cultural impact and business results."

    "year": 2019,
    "award": "Silver",
    "category": "Social & Influencer",
    "insight": "Wendy's core brand promise is 'fresh, never frozen' beef. In the game Fortnite, a virtual 'Food Fight' mode had players choosing between Team Burger and Team Pizza - and the burger restaurant in-game had freezers full of beef.",
    "single_minded_proposition": "Even in virtual worlds, Wendy's destroys freezers wherever it finds them.",
    "strategy": "Instead of buying media in Fortnite, enter the game as a player. Create a Wendy's avatar and livestream it destroying every freezer in the Burger restaurant - staying in character as the brand that never freezes beef.",
    "creative_idea": "A Wendy's-haired avatar entered Fortnite's Food Fight mode and spent the entire time destroying in-game freezers, ignoring opponents, while Twitch-streaming the whole thing.",
    "why_it_won": "Absurdly single-minded execution of a brand truth in an unexpected context. One insight (fresh, never frozen), one action (destroy freezers), one platform. No media spend - pure earned attention.",
    "effectiveness_notes": "1.5M minutes watched on Twitch. 119% increase in social mentions. Zero paid media. Proof that executing a single brand truth with creative commitment generates disproportionate fame."
