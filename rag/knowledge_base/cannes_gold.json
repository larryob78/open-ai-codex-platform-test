    "campaign": "Fearless Girl",
    "brand": "State Street Global Advisors",
    "agency": "McCann New York",
    "year": 2017,
    "award": "Grand Prix / Gold",
    "category": "Glass Lion, Outdoor, PR, Titanium",
    "insight": "Only 25% of senior roles in financial services are held by women, and less than 5% of S&P 500 companies have female CEOs. There is a powerful cultural tension around gender equality in business.",
    "single_minded_proposition": "One small statue can start a movement for change in corporate boardrooms.",
    "strategy": "Rather than running traditional advertising about gender diversity, create a physical symbol of female empowerment placed directly in front of Wall Street's Charging Bull. Let culture and earned media do the work.",
    "creative_idea": "A 4-foot bronze statue of a young girl defiantly facing down the Charging Bull on Wall Street, installed on International Women's Day.",
    "why_it_won": "Combined a powerful cultural insight with a single bold action. No media buy needed - earned $7.4 billion in free media. Drove 384% increase in traffic to SHE fund. Proof that a single-minded idea with cultural tension creates fame.",
    "effectiveness_notes": "The campaign generated massive earned media, social engagement, and real business results. It demonstrated the IPA principle that emotional, fame-driving campaigns massively outperform rational ones."

    "campaign": "The Last Photo",
    "brand": "ITV / CALM (Campaign Against Living Miserably)",
    "agency": "adam&eveDDB London",
    "year": 2022,
    "award": "Gold",
    "category": "Film, Health & Wellness",
    "insight": "People assume suicidal people look visibly distressed. In reality, 3 out of 4 people who die by suicide show no obvious signs. This misconception prevents people from checking in on loved ones.",
    "single_minded_proposition": "Suicide doesn't always look like suicide. The biggest clue can be no clue at all.",
    "strategy": "Challenge the assumption that suicidal people are easy to spot. Use real last photos of real people who died by suicide - photos in which they look happy - to shatter the myth and drive behaviour change.",
    "creative_idea": "A gallery of joyful, ordinary 'last photos' of real people before they took their own lives. Each photo looked perfectly normal - that was the entire point.",
    "why_it_won": "A devastating reframe of an assumption. Single-minded to the extreme. The gap between what you see (happy photos) and what happened (suicide) is the entire creative tension. Drives a clear desired response: check in on people even when they seem fine.",
    "effectiveness_notes": "Calls to CALM's helpline increased 30%. Demonstrated that the most powerful briefs start with a single human truth that reframes how people see the world."

    "campaign": "It's a Tide Ad",
    "brand": "Tide (P&G)",
    "agency": "Saatchi & Saatchi New York",
    "year": 2018,
    "award": "Gold",
    "category": "Film",
    "insight": "Every ad on TV features clean clothes. People never notice because it's invisible. Tide is hiding in plain sight in every commercial ever made.",
    "single_minded_proposition": "Every ad is a Tide ad because every ad features clean clothes.",
    "strategy": "Own the Super Bowl by hijacking every other ad genre. If every ad features clean clothes, every ad is secretly a Tide ad. Turn competitors' conventions against them.",
    "creative_idea": "A series of Super Bowl ads that spoof other ad genres (car, beer, perfume, etc.), revealing each time that 'it's actually a Tide ad' because the clothes are clean.",
    "why_it_won": "Brilliantly single-minded. One insight, one idea, executed across every possible genre. It reframed the entire Super Bowl ad break as Tide content. Classic example of the Creative Ladder - taking a mundane product truth and making it famous.",
    "effectiveness_notes": "Most talked-about Super Bowl advertiser. 164K mentions in first 6 hours. Proved that a single-minded proposition executed with creativity generates outsized returns."

    "agency": "Ogilvy Brazil",
    "year": 2013,
    "award": "Grand Prix / Gold",
    "category": "Titanium, Film",
    "insight": "Only 4% of women around the world consider themselves beautiful. Women are their own worst critics when it comes to their appearance.",
    "single_minded_proposition": "You are more beautiful than you think.",
    "strategy": "Prove to women that their self-perception is distorted by having an FBI-trained sketch artist draw them twice: once based on their own description, once based on a stranger's description. The gap between the two reveals the truth.",
    "creative_idea": "An FBI-trained forensic artist draws women based on their own description vs. a stranger's. The stranger's sketch is always more beautiful, proving women underestimate their own beauty.",
    "why_it_won": "Universal insight, simple execution, deeply emotional. The single-minded proposition 'you are more beautiful than you think' was proven through an experiment rather than stated in a headline. Emotion over information.",
    "effectiveness_notes": "Most watched online ad ever at launch (114M views in first month). Drove measurable uplift in brand preference. IPA evidence: emotional campaigns that achieve fame deliver the strongest long-term business effects."

    "agency": "FCB New York",
    "year": 2019,
    "award": "Grand Prix / Gold",
    "category": "Direct, Mobile",
    "insight": "Burger King's biggest rival has 14,000 more locations. People pass a McDonald's far more often than a BK. Instead of fighting this disadvantage, weaponise it.",
    "single_minded_proposition": "Turn every McDonald's into a Burger King ordering point.",
    "strategy": "Use geofencing technology to offer a 1-cent Whopper to anyone who orders through the BK app while within 600 feet of a McDonald's. Turn the competitor's biggest advantage (location density) into a BK customer acquisition tool.",
    "creative_idea": "Order a 1-cent Whopper from the BK app - but only when you're standing inside or next to a McDonald's. The app redirects you to the nearest Burger King.",
    "why_it_won": "A single-minded idea that turned a competitive weakness into a strength. Bold, cheeky, and measurably effective. The strategy and creative were inseparable - a hallmark of Cannes-winning work.",
    "effectiveness_notes": "1.5M app downloads in 9 days. BK app went from #686 to #1 in App Store. 37:1 return on investment. Demonstrates that sharp strategic thinking combined with bold creative execution drives outsized results."

    "award": "Grand Prix / Gold",
    "category": "Social & Influencer, Radio & Audio",
    "insight": "The British Museum's collection includes thousands of contested artefacts taken from colonised nations. The museum presents them with sanitised plaques that omit their violent origins.",
    "single_minded_proposition": "The stories the British Museum won't tell you, told inside the British Museum itself.",
    "strategy": "Create an unofficial audio-visual tour inside the British Museum using AR and podcast technology that tells the unfiltered, contested history of 10 stolen artefacts - accessible only when standing in front of each object.",
    "creative_idea": "An Instagram AR filter and podcast series that reveals the true colonial history of contested artefacts, geo-triggered inside the British Museum.",
    "why_it_won": "Subversive, culturally urgent, and technically innovative. A single-minded reframe: the same objects, radically different stories. The desired response is crystal clear - see these artefacts differently. Challenge an institution by working inside it.",
    "effectiveness_notes": "8M+ podcast downloads. Demonstrated that the best briefs identify a powerful tension and give creative teams permission to be genuinely provocative."
