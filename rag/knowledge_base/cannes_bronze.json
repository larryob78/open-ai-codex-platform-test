    "agency": "AMV BBDO London",
    "year": 2018,
    "award": "Bronze",
    "category": "PR, Direct",
    "insight": "There is a mass of plastic waste in the Pacific Ocean the size of France. Despite this, no government has taken responsibility because it doesn't belong to anyone's territory.",
    "single_minded_proposition": "If you can't clean the trash, make the trash into a country - and force world leaders to deal with it.",
    "strategy": "Apply to the United Nations to register the Pacific garbage patch as a country called 'Trash Isles'. Submit a formal petition with a flag, currency, passport, and celebrity citizen (Al Gore). Force the plastic pollution issue onto a political stage.",
    "creative_idea": "A formal application to the UN to recognise the Pacific garbage patch as a sovereign nation, complete with a national flag, currency, anthem, and a petition for citizenship.",
    "why_it_won": "Audacious reframe that turned an environmental statistic into a political action. Single-minded idea executed with total commitment. Clear desired response: political pressure for ocean cleanup legislation.",
    "effectiveness_notes": "200 countries covered the story. 250K+ citizenship applications. UN Environment Programme committed to action. Shows that a provocative reframe with complete creative commitment creates disproportionate impact."

    "agency": "FCB Chicago",
    "year": 2021,
    "award": "Bronze",
    "category": "Design, Direct",
    "insight": "After the George Floyd protests, businesses in cities boarded up their storefronts. These boards became canvases for protest art - which was then thrown away when businesses reopened.",
    "single_minded_proposition": "Turn the boards that divided us into tools that unite us - voter registration booths.",
    "strategy": "Collect the plywood protest art boards from boarded-up businesses, preserve the artwork, and repurpose the boards into voter registration booths placed in underserved communities for the 2020 election.",
    "creative_idea": "Protest art boards from boarded-up businesses were preserved and reconstructed into functional voter registration booths deployed across underserved communities.",
    "why_it_won": "Beautiful transformation of a cultural moment into democratic action. Each board carried the emotional weight of the protests into the voting booth. Single-minded: from protest to participation.",
    "effectiveness_notes": "Booths placed in areas with historically low voter turnout. Registered thousands of new voters. Demonstrates that great briefs connect cultural tension to a clear, actionable desired response."

    "agency": "David Madrid",
    "year": 2020,
    "award": "Bronze",
    "category": "Social & Influencer, Brand Experience",
    "insight": "In FIFA (the video game), teams wear real-world kit sponsors. Big brands pay millions to sponsor Premier League teams. But what if you sponsored a tiny team in the lowest division?",
    "single_minded_proposition": "Sponsor the least famous team in football so that FIFA gamers make them the most famous team in the world.",
    "strategy": "Sponsor Stevenage FC (League Two - lowest professional tier) with BK branding, then challenge FIFA gamers to play as Stevenage and share their goals on social media for real-world rewards. Turn the cheapest sponsorship in football into the most visible.",
    "creative_idea": "Sponsored Stevenage FC, then launched #StevenageChallenge on social media, rewarding gamers who scored goals wearing the BK kit in FIFA with real Whoppers.",
    "why_it_won": "Genius subversion of the sports sponsorship model. Minimum investment, maximum cultural hack. One insight (gaming + football + cheap sponsorship), one challenge, viral mechanics did the rest.",
    "effectiveness_notes": "25K goals shared. Stevenage became most-used team in FIFA Career Mode. 3.9B impressions on $50K investment. ROI proof that strategic creativity beats spending."

    "year": 2022,
    "award": "Bronze",
    "category": "Film, PR",
    "insight": "Pro-gun politicians refuse to acknowledge the human cost of gun violence. They speak about 'rights' and 'freedom' in the abstract, never confronting the victims directly.",
    "single_minded_proposition": "Make gun advocates unknowingly address the victims they've ignored.",
    "strategy": "Invite prominent gun advocates to speak at what they believe is a high school graduation ceremony. The 3,044 empty chairs represent the students in the class of 2021 who can't graduate because they were killed by gun violence.",
    "creative_idea": "Pro-gun advocates were invited to deliver graduation speeches to rows of 3,044 empty chairs representing students killed by gun violence before they could graduate.",
    "why_it_won": "Devastating single-minded execution. The empty chairs ARE the brief. No explanation needed. The gap between the speakers' hopeful words and the empty seats creates unbearable cognitive dissonance.",
    "effectiveness_notes": "1.7B impressions. 90% positive sentiment. Congressional hearings cited the campaign. Shows that the most effective briefs create experiences that make the audience reach the conclusion themselves."

    "year": 2019,
    "award": "Bronze",
    "category": "Film",
    "insight": "Athletes who challenged the status quo - Kaepernick kneeling, Serena's fight for equality, a football player with no legs - are told their dreams are 'crazy'. But crazy dreams drive progress.",
    "single_minded_proposition": "Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything.",
    "strategy": "Feature Colin Kaepernick - the most divisive athlete in America - as the voice of Nike's 'Just Do It' 30th anniversary. Lean into the controversy rather than away from it. Let the cultural debate become the campaign.",
    "creative_idea": "A manifesto film voiced by Colin Kaepernick celebrating athletes who were told their dreams were crazy but pursued them anyway, culminating in: 'Believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything.'",
    "why_it_won": "The brief was a bet: polarise the audience to galvanise the core. Emotionally charged, culturally divisive, brand-true. The IPA principle of emotion over information at its most extreme. The controversy was the media plan.",
    "effectiveness_notes": "$6B added to brand value. 31% increase in online sales. Proves the IPA finding that emotionally provocative, fame-driving campaigns generate the largest long-term business effects - even when they polarise."

    "single_minded_proposition": "A full Christmas dinner in a tin so gamers never have to leave their screens.",
    "strategy": "Create a real product - a 3-course Christmas dinner layered in a single tin can - designed for gamers who don't want to stop playing. Sell it for real through GAME stores and earn massive PR from the absurdity.",
    "creative_idea": "A tin containing layers of Christmas dinner (starter, main, dessert) designed for gamers, sold in-store at GAME, promoted as the ultimate gaming fuel for Christmas Day.",
    "why_it_won": "A perfectly absurd product-as-advertising idea. Single audience insight (gamers won't stop), single product solution (dinner in a tin), massive earned media from sheer audacity.",
    "effectiveness_notes": "1B+ impressions. Sold out immediately. Became an annual tradition. Demonstrates that a single, surprising insight about your audience can generate fame with zero media spend."
